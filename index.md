## [ScaleShuffler](https://github.com/ryanj92/ScaleShuffler)

An Android app, designed to help practise the scales, arpeggios and broken chords that are required in the ABRSM piano syllabus. I initially created this app to help me prepare for my own Grade 8 piano exam back in November 2018 (which I passed with merit!), and have since decided to develop it further. 

The first version of the app had one button, which returned a random item from the syllabus.

Here are a list of planned features:

- Implementation of Grades 1-8 in order to cover the whole ABRSM catalogue.
- An 'exam-style' format, which provides one item from each category similar to what would happen in an exam.
- The ability to practise items from individual categories, e.g. only scales in similar motion, only arpeggios, etc.
- The ability to rate performances of items in the 'exam-style' format and provide a log, so users can check their progression over time.
