            <img src="images/profile_pic.jpg" alt="A picture of me." id="self-pic">

            <p>I am a 26 year old PhD student, studying Physics at the University of Nottingham. My interest in coding 
                began during my undergraduate and graduate studies, during which I did a lot of numerical programming using
                tools such as MATLAB, Mathematica and Python.</p>

            <p>In the last year I have decided that I want to pursue a career in software development, so I have spent 
                a good chunk of time learning the fundamentals of computer science and branching out to other languages. 
                Recently I have decided to start putting all this learning to good use and started working on some projects!</p>

            <p>This web page provides a summary of <a href="https://github.com/ryanj92">my GitHub profile</a>.</p>

            <h1>Current projects</h1>

            <p>Here is a list of my current personal projects:</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/ryanj92/ScaleShuffler">ScaleShuffler</a></h2>

            <p>An Android app, designed to help practise the scales, arpeggios and broken chords 
                that are required in the ABRSM piano syllabus. I initially created this app to help me 
                prepare for my own Grade 8 piano exam back in November 2018 (which I passed with merit!).</p>

            <p>The first version of the app had just one button, which returned a random item from 
                the syllabus! Whilst this was enough for me to get by, I decided it would be a good 
                first project to try and flesh this out into a full app.</p>

            <p>Here are a list of planned features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of Grades 1-8 in order to cover the whole ABRSM catalogue.</li>
                <li>An 'exam-style' format, which provides one item from each category similar to 
                what would happen in an exam.</li>
                <li>The ability to practise items from individual categories, e.g. only scales in 
                similar motion, only arpeggios, etc.</li>
                <li>The ability to rate performances of items in the 'exam-style' format and provide 
                a log, so users can check their progression over time.</li>
            </ul>
