            <p>I am a 26 year old PhD student, studying Physics at the University of Nottingham. My interest in coding 
                began during my undergraduate and graduate studies, during which I did a lot of numerical programming using
                tools such as MATLAB, Mathematica and Python.</p>

            <p>In the last year I have decided that I want to pursue a career in software development, so I have spent 
                a good chunk of time learning the fundamentals of computer science and branching out to other languages. 
                Recently I have decided to start putting all this learning to good use and started working on some projects!</p>
